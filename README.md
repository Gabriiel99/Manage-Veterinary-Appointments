# Manage-Veterinary-Appointments

Manager of appointments of patients of a veterinarian.

We have a form where we will validate each one. If the fields are empty, we will get an error since they must all be completed. Once the form is completed, it will show us a correct alert on the right side. We can delete and edit the appointment as many times as we want as well as create appointments.

In this project we work with
* DOM
* Modules
* Validations
* Form
